## Analysis for temperatures in June and December and Recommendations

While there is not much temperature difference between average temperatures in June and December, we can clearly see other differences such as minimum temperatures in December are lower compared to June, but the higher temperatures tend to stay about the same, the same distance as the averages. Thus, we can expect a lower, colder temperatures in December nights compared to June nights, but almost the same higher temperatures throughout daytime.


We can further investigate surrounding months such as April, May, July and November, January, February to perhaps get a better idea of a "seasonal" temperature season rather than just two months. Also, we can gather data on precipitation around these months to compare which seasons might suit our booming business. And I can strongly suggest implementing a rain-check prediction based on previous years so we can fairly predict with decent accuracy as to when it might rain so we can slow our resources and spend less.
